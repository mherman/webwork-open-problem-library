BEGIN_TEXT
Consider the function \( \displaystyle f(x) = $func\), with \(p,q \) nonnegative integers. This function can be represented by a Maclaurin series \( \displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_n x^n \). Some, but not all, of the coefficients \(c_n\) are equal to zero. Answer the following:
$PAR
(i) Which power of \(x\), in terms of \(p\) and \(q\), is the first one to have a nonzero coefficient? $BR
Answer: \{ans_rule(0)\}
$PAR
(ii) What is the coefficient for the term you found in (i)?$BR
Answer: \{ans_rule(30)\}
$PAR
(iii) Which power of x, in terms of \(p\) and \(q\), is the seond to have a nonzero coefficient? $BR
Answer: \{ans_rule(30)\}
$PAR
(iv) What is the coefficient of the term you found in (iii)?
$BR
Answer: \{ans_rule(0)\}
$PAR
(v) Which power of \(x\), in terms of \(p\) and \(q\), is the third one to have a nonzero coefficient? $BR
Answer: \{ans_rule(30)\}
$PAR
(vi) What is the coefficient of the term you found in (v)? $BR
Answer: \{ans_rule(30)\}
